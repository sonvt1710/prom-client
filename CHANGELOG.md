  subclassed the built-in metric types you may need to adjust your code.

### Changed

- Improve types for no labels
- perf: Faster stats gathering with lower memory overhead
- Simplified number format logic
- Simplified Histogram.observe() call stack
- Fix memory leak in cluster.js by deleting all expired requests
- perf: Sped up Map accesses
- perf: Remove truthy conditionals in hot code paths
- Show the invalid name in the validation errors
- perf: Improve performance of registry defaultLabels during metric processing
- perf: New, more space-efficient storage engine, 20-45% faster stats recording

### Added

- Expanded benchmarking code

[15.1.0]: https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/compare/v15.0.0...v15.1.0

## [15.0.0] - 2023-10-09

### Breaking

- drop support for Node.js versions 10, 12, 14, 17 and 19

### Changed

- Refactor histogram internals and provide a fast path for rendering metrics to
  Prometheus strings when there are many labels shared across different values.
- Disable custom content encoding for pushgateway delete requests in order to
  avoid failures from the server when using `Content-Encoding: gzip` header.
- Refactor `escapeString` helper in `lib/registry.js` to improve performance and
  avoid an unnecessarily complex regex.
- Cleanup code and refactor to be more efficient
- Correct TS types for working with OpenMetrics
- Updated Typescript and Readme docs for `setToCurrentTime()` to reflect units as seconds.
- Do not ignore error if request to pushgateway fails
- Make sure to reject the request to pushgateway if it times out

### Added

- Support for OpenMetrics and Exemplars

[15.0.0]: https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/compare/v14.2.0...v15.0.0

## [14.2.0] - 2023-03-06

### Changed

- Refactor `getMetricAsPrometheusString` method in the `Registry` class to use `Array.prototype.join`
  instead of loop of string concatenations.
- Also use `Array.prototype.map`, and object spread instead of an explicit `for` loop
- changed: updated the sample output in `example/default-metrics.js`
- `summary` metrics now has a `pruneAgedBuckets` config parameter
  to remove entries without any new values in the last `maxAgeSeconds`.
  Default is `false` (old behavior)

### Added

- Add `get` method to type definitions of metric classes

[14.2.0]: https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/compare/v14.1.1...v14.2.0

## [14.1.1] - 2022-12-31

### Changed

- Increase compatibility with external build system such as `rollup` by making perf_hooks optional in gc.js

[14.1.1]: https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/compare/v14.1.0...v14.1.1

## [14.1.0] - 2022-08-23

### Changed

- types: converted all the generic Metric types to be optional

- The `done()` functions returned by `gauge.startTimer()` and
  `summary.startTimer()` now return the timed duration. Histograms already had
  this behavior.

- types: fixed type for `registry.getMetricsAsArray()`

- Improve performance of `gague.inc()` and `gauge.dec()` by calling `hashObject()` once.

### Added

- The `processResources` metric was added, which keeps a track of all sorts of
  active resources. It consists of the following gauges:
  - `nodejs_active_resources` - Number of active resources that are currently
    keeping the event loop alive, grouped by async resource type.
  - `nodejs_active_resources_total` - Total number of active resources.
    It is supposed to provide the combined result of the `processHandles` and
    `processRequests` metrics along with information about any other types of
    async resources that these metrics do not keep a track of (like timers).

- Support gzipped pushgateway requests

[14.1.0]: https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/compare/v14.0.1...v14.1.0

## [14.0.1] - 2021-11-02

### Changed

- changed: typedef for pushgateway to reflect js implementation.

[14.0.1]: https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/compare/v14.0.0...v14.0.1

## [14.0.0] - 2021-09-18

### Breaking

- changed: `linearBuckets` does not propagate rounding errors anymore.

  Fewer bucket bounds will be affected by rounding errors. Histogram bucket
  labels may change. [`6f1f3b2`](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/commit/6f1f3b24c9c21311ff33e7d4b987b40c6b304e04)

- changed: The push gateway methods `pushAdd()`, `push()` and `delete()` now
  return Promises instead of accepting a callback:

  ```js
  // Old:
  gateway.pushAdd({ jobName: 'test' }, (err, resp, body) => {});
  // New:
  gateway
    .pushAdd({ jobName: 'test' })
    .then(({ resp, body }) => {})
    .catch(err => {});
  // or
  const { resp, body } = await gateway.pushAdd({ jobName: 'test' });
  ```

  [`f177b1f`](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/commit/f177b1fd3d4db5fc48fcb1ec02d94069fffcf144)

- changed: The default `nodejs_eventloop_lag_*` metrics are now reset every time
  they are observed. This prevents these metrics from "stabilizing" over a long
  period of time and becoming insensitive to small changes. For more info, see
  [#370](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/issues/370). [`0f444cd`](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/commit/0f444cd38e4c7074991270106c270f731bafddb8)

### Changed

- Add missing `await`/`then`s to examples. [`074f339`](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/commit/074f339914e5d71b5829cd4a949affae23dbc409)
- Add missing type declaration for `client.contentType`. [`3b66641`](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/commit/3b6664160bdd1555045b03d8f4c421022f30e1db)
- Modernize some label processing code. [`c9bf1d8`](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/commit/c9bf1d8e3db3b5fb97faf2df9ca9b9af670288f3)

[14.0.0]: https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/compare/v13.2.0...v14.0.0

## [13.2.0] - 2021-08-08

### Added

- feat: added `zero()` to `Histogram` for setting the metrics for a given label combination to zero
- fix: allow `Gauge.inc/dec(0)` without defaulting to 1

[13.2.0]: https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/compare/v13.1.0...v13.2.0

## [13.1.0] - 2021-01-24

### Changed

- fix: push client attempting to write Promise (fixes [#390](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/issues/390))
- types: improve type checking of labels
- fix: Summary#observe should throw when adding additional labels to labelset (fixes [#262](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/issues/262))

### Added

- feat: added the ability to pass labels as an object to `labels()` and `remove()`
- Added: More examples with commented output

[13.1.0]: https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/compare/v13.0.0...v13.1.0

## [13.0.0] - 2020-12-16

### Breaking

- changed: The following functions are now async (return a promise):
  `registry.metrics()`
  `registry.getMetricsAsJSON()`
  `registry.getMetricsAsArray()`
  `registry.getSingleMetricAsString()`

  If your metrics server has a line like `res.send(register.metrics())`, you
  should change it to `res.send(await register.metrics())`.

  Additionally, all metric types now accept an optional `collect` function,
  which is called when the metric's value should be collected and within which
  you should set the metric's value. You should provide a `collect` function for
  point-in-time metrics (e.g. current memory usage, as opposed to HTTP request
  durations that are continuously logged in a histogram).

- changed: `register.clusterMetrics()` no longer accepts a callback; it only
  returns a promise.

- removed: v12.0.0 added the undocumented functions `registry.registerCollector`
  and `registry.collectors()`. These have been removed. If you were using them,
  you should instead provide a `collect` function as described above.

### Changed

- fix: provide nodejs_version_info metric value after calling `registry.resetMetrics()` (#238)
- fix: provide process_max_fds metric value after calling `registry.resetMetrics()`
- fix: provide process_start_time_seconds metric value after calling `registry.resetMetrics()`
- chore: improve performance of `registry.getMetricAsPrometheusString`
- chore: refactor metrics to reduce code duplication
- chore: replace `utils.getPropertiesFromObj` with `Object.values`
- chore: remove unused `catch` bindings
- chore: upgrade Prettier to 2.x
- fix: startTimer returns `number` in typescript instead of `void`
- fix: incorrect typings of `registry.getSingleMetric' (#388)
- chore: stop testing node v13 on CI

### Added

- feat: exposed `registry.registerCollector()` and `registry.collectors()` methods in TypeScript declaration
- Added: complete working example of a pushgateway push in `example/pushgateway.js`
- feat: added support for adding labels to default metrics (#374)
- Added CHANGELOG reminder

[13.0.0]: https://github.com/siimon/prom-client/compare/v12.0.0...v13.0.0

## [12.0.0] - 2020-02-20

### Breaking

- Dropped support for end-of-life Node.js versions 6.x and 8.x
- Dropped the previously deprecated support for positional parameters in
  constructors, only the config object forms remain.
- Default metrics are collected on scrape of metrics endpoint, not on an
  interval. The `timeout` option to `collectDefaultMetrics(conf)` is no longer
  supported or needed, and the function no longer returns a `Timeout` object.

### Changed

- chore: remove ignored package-lock.json
- fix: `process_max_fds` is process limit, not OS (#314)
- Changed `Metric` labelNames & labelValues in TypeScript declaration to a generic type `T extends string`, instead of `string`

- fix: avoid mutation bug in `registry.getMetricsAsJSON()`
- fix: improve performance of `registry.getMetrics*`
- End function of histogram `startTimer`, when invoked returns the number of seconds
- chore: reindent package.json
- chore: correct var name in processStartTime
- chore: add test for `process_start_time_seconds`
- chore: spelling corrections in README

### Added

- feat: implement GC metrics collection without native(C++) modules.
- feat: implement advanced event loop monitoring
